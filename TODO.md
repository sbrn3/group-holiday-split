Make it so that if there are multiple options it sorts by gender.

Implement the recommendations from the following paper

Couples are assigned a multiplier. Essentially an arbitrary hyperparameter that defines how strongly you want to keep couples together. e.g. if it were equal to 2 then two individuals would need to bid twice as much as a couple to take that room away from them. But if the parameter then any two individuals would be just as likely to be placed into a room together (no tendency to put couples together).
