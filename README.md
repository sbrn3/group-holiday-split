# group-holiday-split
Have you ever booked out an apartment or house as part of a group holiday? A common problem is figuring out the prices that everyone should pay especially if the rooms have different utilities. 

This is extremely similar to a rent splitting strategy except there are a few variables that may be different in this particular case.
Are there people that would prefer to be in the same room but could technically be split (couples). 

Also people may not be requiring accomodation for all the nights and therefore space might be wasted if they don't plan
