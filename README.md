# group-holiday-split
Have you ever booked out an apartment or house as part of a group holiday? A common problem is figuring out the prices 
that everyone should pay especially if the rooms have different utilities. 

This is extremely similar to a rent splitting strategy except there are a few variables that may be different in this 
particular case.
Are there people that would prefer to be in the same room but could technically be split (couples). 

Also people may not be requiring accomodation for all the nights and therefore space might be wasted if they don't plan
on using a good room for all the nights.  

# Rules of the auction

1. Bid a value on each bed type. 

2. The total of your bids must equal (or more than) the cost per night for the entire house. 

# Result

If you bid the highest then you get that room. If you have valued the room more than other people then price you pay is 
the average of everyone's values. We have also decided that while different genders are allowed to share a room together, 
they will not be sharing a bed unless they are a couple. 

# Tips

If you bid too high you will pay too much for that room. If you bid too low you will not get the room. 
The amount that you should bid should determine how much you value the features of that room. For example it may be 
really important to you that you get a nice bed but for another person it is more important to get a nice view. So you
would each bid more on different rooms. 

If you want to share a room with a friend then you have to bid more on the room you want to share. Hopefully you will 
win that auction and both be assigned to that room. 

If you are not there for all the nights you will be disadvantaged because you are paying less by not staying. Because 
this gives the best rooms to the people who pay the most you will probably not get good rooms. A way to make up for this 
is to have the total of your bids be more than the price of the house per night. This means that you are willing to 
pay for more than you are actually staying. Of course you are then subsidizing everyone else's stay, but if you are 
willing to pay to leave a good room empty, then it is up to you.
